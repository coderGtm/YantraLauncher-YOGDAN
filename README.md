# UPDATE (NOV 2023):
Yantra Launcher is now fully open source so this repository is now no longer being worked upon and is **archived**!

# YantraLauncher-Yogdan
This repository is for contributing code to be used in the Closed-Source Yantra Launcher for increasing Development Speed, testing pre-release builds, and finding bugs faster. 🐛🚀

## Why this name 🤔
You Probably already know the reason behind the name of Yantra Launcher. Yeah right, **Yantra**_(yan·truh)_ means Device and so this Launcher is basically a minimal Launcher for your device. 📱

Now coming to **Yogdan** _(/yogadāna/ Sanskrit योगदान)_: **Yogdan** means Your Contribution. This repo is created for contributing to the Yantra Launcher.🙌

## Back-Story 📖
First of all, thank you for all the love for Yantra Launcher. When I started this project, I didn't expect that there are people like me who really love these kind of apps. As time passed by, more and more people, including programmers, senior managers, gamers, Youtubers, etc., started using Yantra Launcher as their default Home Screen and we are still a rapidly growing family. ❤️

As the number of users increased, so did their likes and dislikes and feature requests. This is the best phase as we can get feedback and discuss the app from a wide variety of people who actually care about improving what they use daily.

But this has also led to a slightly increased load on me as a solo Developer, juggling between University, side-projects, internships, and other things. But thankfully we also have some members in the community who really love to contribute to the project using their Development Skills. That's when I decided to have ***a repo where users of the app can also help with the development of the app.***

## How to contribute? 🤝
Thank you once again for deciding to contribute to the app. I am really grateful to you all! 🙏❤️

Open a terminal and Clone the repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/coderGtm/YantraLauncher-Yogdan.git
```

**It is recommended to have Android Studio for development**

Open the [MainActivity.Kt](app/src/main/java/com/coderGtm/ylTester/MainActivity.kt) file. It features 2 important functions:
1. `printToConsole`
2. `cmdHandler`

As intuitive as it seems, `printToConsole` is used to print output to the terminal.
On the contrary, `cmdHandler` is the function through which commands entered in the terminal are passed.

Read the file thoroughly and you will understand how commands are handled in Yantra Launcher and how to define your own command.

The Android Project that you just cloned, **YL Tester** is a bare-bone implementation of Yantra Launcher, used for command testing purposes. When you implement your new command, you can test it by running this project.

- Now to contribute a new command from scratch to this repository, once you have tested it on **YL Tester**, upload it in the [commands](/commands) directory like the sample command shown in [sendtext.kt](commands/sendText.kt) file.

- To improve an existing command that's available in the [commands](/commands) directory, simply open a pull request with your modified command. 🛠️🔄

- To improve an existing command that's not found in the [commands](/commands) directory, open an issue and we will discuss it there if I can provide the code for the existing command.  💻🔧


## What will I get? 🌟
***Satisfaction!*** Although I can't remunerate you for your contribution, you will get recognition if your contribution is used in the Yantra Launcher. There are a couple of perks that are yet to be listed, but please do not spam for getting a Contributor Tag. Such requests will be rejected as they defy the purpose of this repository. Contribute only if you feel so, not for any perks. 🙏


## FAQs ❓
1. **💰 Why are there some paid plugins in Yantra Launcher?**

    It takes an immense amount of time, energy, and effort other than the monetary costs of developing and maintaining the application. Although the app is freely available on the Play Store, I have added some paid plugins that are not required but are there just to enhance the experience a little bit. When you buy these plugins, ***you help me cover some of the costs that I bear for the application, apart from getting the associated motivation.*** Plus, I don't want to include ads in the app like other similar apps do, as it defies the purpose of a minimal distraction-free Home Screen.

2. **📂 Why don't you open-source the application entirely?**

    I understand that it would be more intuitive to contribute if the application was completely open-source but as I said above, It takes an immense amount of time, energy, and effort other than the monetary costs of developing and maintaining the application. If I open-source it, not everyone is good enough to uphold their moral values and responsibilities. ***Some random dude, trying to look nerdy will fork it, remove all paywalls, and release it on the store.*** And due to the nature of open-source, I can't, and even don't have the time to, deny him/her. _I hope you understand!_ 🤝
